        This internship project is about a service internal to Google that is
        responsible for dynamically pushing pieces of configuration or data to
        running processes.
        </br></br>
        <b>Motivations</b></br></br>
        The two main questions this project tries to address are:<br>
        1. how do the start and end of all pushes in a push def line up against
        each other?<br>
        2. how does a current push compare against previous pushes?</br></br>
        <b>Terminology</b></br></br>
        A <i>push definition</i> (push def) describes a particular push. The most
        relevant information for this project is that a push def describes how a
        push is split in several stages. At Google, the push defs are organized
        in a tree hierarchy but, for simplicity, in this project we only used a
        flat list of push defs.</br></br>
        Each push for a particular push def is identified by a <i>push handle</i>.
        The handle is composed by joining the name for the push def with a push
        ID.</br></br>
        For each push there is a <i>push info</i> that describes what happened
        during a particular push. This includes information about when the push
        started and when the transition from one stage+state to the next
        happened.</br></br>
        A push is split in several <i>stages</i>, with each stage updating only
        a subset of the consumers. Each stage also has an attempt counter
        associated with it because a stage can be retried several times. Each
        stage can go through several states before completing. </br></br>
        <b>Bar Chart</b></br></br>
        The bar chart is a visualization element that helps with the second
        major question: how does a current push compare against previous pushes,
        when the number of pushes is not very large?</br></br>
        The bar chart displays the pushes in chronological order, because the
        pushes happened most recently are probably more important to the user.
        The y axis of the bar chart is the duration of a single push, with the
        most common time unit of the pushes. The bar chart consists of a focus
        bar chart, a compressed bar chart with a selector, and a box plot. The
        focus bar chart shows a default number of pushes when the user opens the
        page.</br></br>
        There are several interactive features integrated in the bar chart. The
        user can use the <span class="gold">selector</span> to slide among the
        bars and select any portion to display. The <span class="gold">drop down
        menu</span> lets the user to switch between all pushes and completed
        pushes. When the user <span class="gold">hovers</span> on a bar or the
        empty area above it, the bar will be highlighted and a tooltip with the
        push's pushID, end state, and start time will appear on top of the bar,
        as well as a tag with the duration of the push.</br></br>
        <b>Box Plot</b></br></br>
        The bar chart also features a box plot that allows the user to compare
        the current push duration to the previous pushes and helps the user
        predict the completion time of an ongoing push. The box plot contains
        <span class="gold">five labels</span> that show the minimum, first
        quantile(25%), median, third quantile(75%), and maximum duration of the
        pushes appeared in the focus bar chart.</br></br>
        When the selector updates the focus bar chart or the
        selection of the drop down menu changes, the box plot will be updated
        with the new input data. When user hovers over the bar chart, the
        corresponding data point in the box plot will be highlighted. The points
        in the box plot will switch to a smaller radius to show the distribution
        better when there are too many data points.
